Description: C++ wrappers for GTK+ 2 (development files)
 Gtkmm is a C++ interface for the popular GUI library GTK+, with API version
 2.4.  Gtkmm provides a convenient interface for C++ programmers to create
 graphical user interfaces with GTK+'s flexible OO framework. Highlights
 include type safe callbacks, widgets extensible using inheritance and over 180
 classes that can be freely combined to quickly create complex user interfaces.
 .
 This package is deprecated. Please see the libgtkmm-3.0-dev package for a
 newer version, which wraps GTK+ 3 instead.
 .
 This package contains development files and examples, as well as a gtkmm-demo
 program.
